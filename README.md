I tried to create a hub of programmers, where you can find your programmer and get them to work for you. 

** there are 2 main components:
    1. Header
    2. Programmers
        --> there are 2 more components named Programmer and HiredProgrammers inside Programmers 
        1. Programmer
        2. HiredProgrammers
            --> there is another component named HiredProgrammer inside HiredProgrammers
            1. HiredProgrammer

** there is a fake database named programmers.json inside public folder

** there are event listeners inside the hire me button of every Programmer components
** whenever clicked the button total cost will be updated and the programmer name is added to the right.
